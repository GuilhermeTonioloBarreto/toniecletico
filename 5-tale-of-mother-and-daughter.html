                <p>
                    My mother has always told me that I would only know the sacrifice to be a mother when I became 
                    one. And I have never took that words seriously. However, now I can understand a little of her 
                    mind.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In my entire life, my mother used to humiliate me. From bad words, hitting and make me starving 
                    to psychological and emotional abuse.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I was 13, I felt an enormous desire to life. A big desire of knowing guys, going to parties, 
                    being accepted in the most popular school girls. A huge desire of kissing, and do things beyond kissing. 
                    I was terrified, but something inside had just kept telling to be the girl I always wanted to be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, my mother did not respect this moment of my life. Whenever possible, she told anyone about 
                    intimate things of me, like my breast growing, of my menstruation.  Besides, she ruined every (or almost every) 
                    try of discover this magic world called puberty; I couldn't go to my friend's house, I couldn't watch a movie 
                    at the cinema, I couldn't bring boyfriends at  home (if I brought - and sometimes I tried to - she told a lot of 
                    lies for them, saying how pervert, bitch and horrible I was). It was extremely humiliated and depressive. At the 
                    end of every  embarrassing situation, she used to say "when you become a mother, you will understand why I do this". 
                    I didn't understand that, and my only choice was to come into my bedroom and cry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One day, when she was abusing emotionality of me (saying that no dreams that I aim in this life would be reached) 
                    I get my hand on her neck. I was so nervous with this situation that, all of a sudden, I was trying to hang her. I 
                    couldn't justify the reason that I was doing that. My eyes were with a lot of hatred and, for the first time, my 
                    heart was desiring the blood of that bitch mother. As I was stronger than her, she couldn't escape of that hang. 
                    Every thing was depending on me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My mother stared at me. She didn't try to escape, or scream. She was certainly in suffer, but she didn't move a 
                    finger. I started to get my conscience back. As a result, I decrease the force I was using to hang her. After that, 
                    she just said your famous word: "when you become a mother, you will understand why I do this". After these words, 
                    I released her neck and desperately started to cry. I was deeply ashamed of what I had done to her. My mother recover 
                    yourself and went to her bedroom. No punishment were done to me. It makes me more regret.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The days have passed and the humiliating and suffering life continued the same for me. I could only have a piece 
                    of quiet life when I went to college. I could breathe without judging. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, I am a realtor, married and mother of two teenage girls. They are my happiness, my strength, my reason of life. 
                    They are everything to me. Whenever possible, I treat them with respectful and cordiality, giving them freedom and 
                    teaching the good, the bad, the right and the wrong of the life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this whole time, I could feel a change in my mother. She didn't humiliate me anymore or embarrassed me in front of 
                    people. She was finally treating me as a normal people. Maybe she was afraid of have their only granddaughters put away.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One day, at a family lunch, when everyone were sat around the table, my mother started to tell my daughters how 
                    was my life when I was a teenager. She told the parties that I begged to go, the boyfriends that I brought to 
                    home, my first menstruation. I didn't feel wickedness in these words. I felt nostalgic and proud on her words. 
                    She was just trying to remember some moments with her only daughter. Somehow she had a different sight of every 
                    embarrassed situation I had experienced with her. We have had distorted sights of the same events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After my mother told her memories of our past, I got up and told (looking at mo mother): "Now I understand 
                    why you did this". My mother's eyes filled with tears. Then, I sat down and continued lunching.
